> "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."  
> — Aristotle

This app is built on the principle that **breaking bad habits is just as important as building good ones**. By focusing on what you avoid rather than what you do, you can make meaningful changes in your life, one day at a time.
